Question (a):
Flutter handles the navigation of screens like "stack" where on screen is set on another screen . 
When we instantiate the navigations it uses as push or pop operation just like stack. 
Pushing screen means puting a screen on top and popping means get rid of the screen of the top.

Question (b):

First we assign login screen as our home by home:LoginScreen().Then to navigate from login screen to loading screen the navigator.pushNamed() will put the loading screen 
on top and in the loading screen. After showing the loading screen it will wait for the data and then 
navigator.pushR() will replace the loading screen to SplashScreen.
